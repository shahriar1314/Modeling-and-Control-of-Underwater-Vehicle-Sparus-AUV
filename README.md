**Summary: Modeling and Control of Sparus AUV**

This project focuses on the modeling, analysis, and control of the Sparus Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV), guided by Prof. Mathieu Richier at the University of Toulon. Using MATLAB and Simulink, it explores the vehicle's physical properties, hydrodynamics, and control mechanisms. Key objectives include:

- Dimensional analysis of components.
- Mass matrix and added mass computations.
- Comparison of mass matrices at different points (Center of Gravity vs. Buoyancy).
- Evaluation of drag matrices.
- Simulations to validate the model and analyze the impact of forces.

The project structure includes scripts for MATLAB analysis, Simulink models for simulations, and documentation of results. It aims to provide comprehensive insights into the Sparus AUVâ€™s hydrodynamic behavior and control strategies.
